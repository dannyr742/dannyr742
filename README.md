## Hi there üëã, I'm Daniel Ramirez!

## About Me:
Detail-oriented and analytical recent graduate with a Bachelor's degree in Mathematics and Computer Science, seeking an entry-level Data Analyst position. Skilled in data analysis, statistical modeling, and data visualization with experience in Python, SQL, and data manipulation. Strong ability to interpret and present data to drive business decisions.

## What Am I up To? üìà
I‚Äôm currently working on an exciting data analysis project using mock sales data from **Tillys**, a popular clothing store. The goal is to analyze sales trends during the back-to-school season to identify:

- üìä **Most popular items** during the season.
- üõí **Stock optimization**: What we need more of and less of for the next back-to-school season.

This project involves cleaning and analyzing sales data, creating insightful visualizations, and making data-driven recommendations to improve inventory management.

### Tools and Technologies I'm Using üõ†Ô∏è
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Data Analysis and Manipulation**:
  - `pandas`: To manipulate and analyze sales data.
  - `numpy`: For numerical operations.
- **Data Visualization**:
  - `matplotlib` and `seaborn`: To create charts and visualizations for trends.
- **Data Exploration**:
  - `Jupyter Notebook`: For iterative development and showcasing results.
- **Predictive Modeling**:
  - `scikit-learn`: For basic predictive analytics and forecasting.
- **Data Storage**:
  - `SQLite`: For storing and querying mock sales data.
  - `csv` or `Excel`: For loading the dataset.

### Key Insights I'm Looking For üîç
- **Seasonal Trends**: Which categories (e.g., backpacks, hoodies, sneakers) saw the most sales during the back-to-school season?
- **Inventory Gaps**: Were there stockouts for popular items, and how can we prepare better next year?
- **Low-Performing Items**: What didn‚Äôt sell well, and should we reduce stock for those items in the future?

Stay tuned as I work through this project and share my findings here on my Github!
